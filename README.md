# Melanoma finder

## WWDC Scholarship submission 2019

---
### Summary

For Apple's yearly WWDC Scholarship contest, I made a playround book and focussed on the detection of Melanomas with the iPad.

I used Apple's CreateML tool to train a model containing images of both benign and malignant moles. The used dataset is from the [International Skin Imaging Collaboration](https://www.isic-archive.com). I integrated the model with CoreML into the second and third view.

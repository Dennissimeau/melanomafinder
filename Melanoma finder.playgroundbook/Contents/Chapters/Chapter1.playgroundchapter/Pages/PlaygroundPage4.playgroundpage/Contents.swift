 # Thank you!
 Thank you so much for taking time to take a look at this Playground book! This playground was created because of a close relative of mine suffered from cancer. I truly believe our modern day technology can help us lower the rate of deaths in the future, by assisting in early diagnosis.
 
 This playground was a proof of concept for making machine learning apps with all Apple tools, including the training of the model with CreateML.
